# Watson Cognitive Labs
These Watson Cognitive Labs provide an introduction to using IBM Watson APIs, by guiding the participant through the creation of several prototype applications that utilise IBM Watson cognitive services.

During the course of the two labs, the lab attendee will create:

- a cognitive chatbot
- an image recognition dashboard application
- a simulated drone inspection application
- a cognitive text analysis prototype
- a Twitter language translation app

In building the chatbot, we will expose the attendee to multiple chat user interfaces, and use **Watson Assistant**, **Watson Discovery** and **Watson Natural Language Understanding** services.

The image recognition and drone inspection applications use **Watson Visual Recognition**, and also introduce the user to creating dashboards and mapping applications using Node-RED.

The cognitive text prototype uses the **Watson Natural Language Understanding** service to analyse either raw text or web page content for referenced entities, as well as document sentiment and emotion.

The language translation make use of the **Watson Language Translation** API to automatically translate a user's tweets to another language, if a specific hashtag is used.

## Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud account
- Slack account

## Workshop materials
The workshop materials for each part of the lab are contained in the subfolders README files:
* [Cognitive Lab 1: Cognitive Chatbot Basics](./1-Basics)
* [Cognitive Lab 2: Enhancing Chatbots with Context and Sentiment](./2-Extended)
* [Cognitive Lab 3: Extending Chatbots with Watson Discovery](./3-Discovery)
* [Cognitive Lab 4: Watson Visual Recognition](./4-Visual)
* [Cognitive Lab 5: Watson Natural Language Understanding](./5-NLU)
* [Cognitive Lab 6: Watson Language Translator](./6-Translation)

Chatbot Labs 1-3 should be taken in numerical order - other labs can be followed in any order.

The workshops make extensive use of Node-RED and a small amount of Javascript.

No coding experience is necessary.
