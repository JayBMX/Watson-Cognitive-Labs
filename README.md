# Cognitive Stream
This set of workshops will walk the user through creating both a cognitive chatbot and a simulated drone inspection application.

Building the chatbot will expose the user to multiple chat UIs, and use Watson Conversation, Watson Discovery and Watson Natural Language Understanding services. The drone application uses Watson Visual Recognition, and introduces the user to creating dashboards and mapping applications using Node-RED.

## Workshop materials
The workshop materials for each respective workshop are in the subfolders README files:
* [Cognitive: Basics](./1-Basics)
* [Cognitive: Extended](./2-Extended)
* [Cognitive: Discovery](./3-Discovery)
* [Cognitive: Visual Recognition](./4-Visual)

It is recommended that you follow the materials in this order.  

If you complete the workshops and you'd like to use these skills to build your own chatbot or visual recognition prototype, then you can follow more examples here, which step you through creating a simple GDPR Advisor bot, and building an insurance claim visual inspection app:
* [Cognitive: Extras & Special Features](./X-Special)

The workshops make extensive use of Node-RED and a small amount of Javascript.
No coding experience is necessary.

This material is based on the original Future Skills Academy Watson Developer Cloud cognitive labs written by Daniel Chabr and Viliam Valent of the Watson iLab, and has been modified and extended by Gary Wilson.

The applications used in the Visual Recognition material were created by Douglas McGarrie and Mike Hope.
